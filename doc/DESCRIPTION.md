A puppeting bridge between Matrix and Discord packaged as a YunoHost service. Messages, media and notifications are bridged between a Discord user and a matrix user. The "Mautrix-Discord" bridge consists in a synapse app service and relies on postgresql (mysql also available). Therefore, Synapse for YunoHost should be installed beforehand.

**Attention: always backup and restore the Yunohost matrix_synapse et mautrix_discord apps together!**
